# Page Generator

Using the provided files, create a script that dynamically generates a page based on a JSON file. The JSON file is _not_ provided for you, so go ahead and decide how to structure your data in the way you think is best.

## The files
- index.html: The project file shell for you to work on. 
- index-complete.html: This shows you approximately what your generator should output. Open it in your browser to see the result.
- page-generator.js: The JS file shell for you to write your logic in.
- style.css: The CSS that does the styling. This is done for you, so don't worry about it.
