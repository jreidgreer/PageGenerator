# Page Generator

Using the provided files, create a script that dynamically generates a page based on JSON data. Find a way to represent the elements inside `index-complete.html` in a JSON-like format (feel free to just use regular JS objects). The JSON data is _not_ provided for you, so decide how to structure your data in the way you think is best. Then, use this data to create the elements dynamically inside of `index.html`. If fully completed, `index.html` and `index-complete.html` should be identical after loading.

**NOTE**: The code you use to generate the page should _not_ rely on the specific elements included inside of the `index-complete.html` file. The data should be able to be modified to easily change elements and attributes.

## Getting started
Install dependencies via `npm install`. A copy of [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) is included here, along with a startup script. To see the page you will be working on (and have it update live), use `npm start`.

If you would like to load the completed version of this file for reference, go to `localhost:3000/index-complete.html`.

## The files
- **index.html**: The project file shell for you to work on. 
- **index-complete.html**: This shows you approximately what your generator should output. Open it in your browser to see the result.
- **page-generator.js**: The JS file shell for you to write your logic in.
- **style.css**: The CSS that does the styling. This is done for you, so don't worry about it.
